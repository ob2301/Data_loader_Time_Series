# Time-Series Foundation Models, Research Lab Work (LASS)
UMass LASS Lab work, data_loaders and backbone integration, will reformat for better visual appeal and explain the code at a later date. Simply uploading my work here for our TK.

So far in this repo I have implemented the following:

FordA Time-Series Dataset, Binary Classification, MOMENT Model Backbone. (Yielded ~94% Mean Absolute Error accuracy)

Mantis Model Backbone wrapper class (using FordA Time-Series Dataset as well) (Yielded ~90.1% Mean Absolute Error accuracy)
